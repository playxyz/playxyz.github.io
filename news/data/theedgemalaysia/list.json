            "description": "<div class=\"news-detail_newsTextDataWrap__PkAu5\"><div><div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>(June 19): Luxury brands are putting out more affordable and smaller accessories as they seek to generate store traffic to counter slowing demand, a new report shows. </p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The trend comes after companies faced a consumer backlash over steep price hikes in recent years. Up to a quarter of luxury brands are embracing this strategy to keep shoppers visiting their stores, according to Claudia D’Arpizio, a partner at Bain &amp; Co, which issued the report Thursday. </p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>“They understood that they needed to recalibrate,” she said in an interview. </p></div><div class=\"inPageAd\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-inpage\"></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>While it’s harder to introduce more affordable products in categories such as leather goods, shoes and ready-to-wear, some labels are finding ways around it, notably by using textiles.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>LVMH’s Loewe, known for leather bags that can cost €5,200 (US$5,980 or RM25,399), is currently offering a drawstring pouch bag in a sponge-like cloth for €280, for instance.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Brands are also introducing new products in cheaper categories such as costume jewellery, eyewear and beauty in a bid to attract younger customers especially, according to D’Arpizio.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The shift comes after luxury product prices grew as much as 12% on average annually between 2022 and the first half of last year, which turned away many shoppers. The personal luxury-goods industry, worth €364 billion, lost 50 million customers in 2023 and 2024, Bain estimated last year.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The sector will shrink between 2% and 5% this year after showing no change last year, according to the most likely scenario highlighted in Bain’s latest report. That’s set to be the worst performance since the 2009 global financial crisis if the pandemic is excluded. What’s more, China was growing then and it no longer is, D’Arpizio added. </p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Separately, she described the surprise appointment of carmaker Renault SA’s Luca de Meo as chief executive of Gucci owner Kering SA as a “good move” in an industry that tends to operate in a closed circuit. Auto and luxury face similar challenges, with slowing growth and pressure on margins, she added.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p><em>Uploaded by Chng Shear Lane</em></p></div>\n</div></div>",

That was 15.2% higher than the prior year's 742.8 billion yuan.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The festival, originally a single-day event celebrating JD.com's founding on June 18, has evolved into a month-long affair spanning all major e-commerce platforms.</p></div><div class=\"inPageAd\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-inpage\"></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>This year's pre-sales began on May 13, a week longer than in 2024, leading to lower average daily spending of 23.1 billion yuan, compared with 24.8 billion yuan last year, according to <em>Reuters </em>calculations.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Alibaba Group's Tmall kept its top position on sales, the data showed, followed by JD.com, ByteDance's Douyin and Pinduoduo Holdings' Pinduoduo.

            "description": "<div class=\"news-detail_newsTextDataWrap__PkAu5\"><div><div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>(June 19): Nestlé SA extended its leadership overhaul by proposing longtime Inditex SA executive Pablo Isla as its next chairman to succeed company veteran Paul Bulcke when he retires next year.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The move by the Swiss owner of Nespresso coffee and Purina pet food follows the surprise ouster of CEO Mark Schneider last year. His successor, Laurent Freixe, has been trying to restore sales growth as the Swiss company confronts challenges including rising costs and trade wars.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>In contrast to the abrupt change of CEOs, Nestlé signalled an orderly transition from Bulcke to Isla, who’s currently vice-chairman of the board. He’ll stand for election to the new role at the next shareholder meeting in April, the company said Wednesday in a statement.</p></div><div class=\"inPageAd\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-inpage\"></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Isla was chief executive officer of Inditex, the Spanish apparel multi-national and owner of the Zara fashion brand, from 2005 to 2011, and chairman of the same company from 2011 until 2022. He has served on Nestlé’s board since 2018.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The Spanish executive, 61, is credited with expanding on Inditex founder Amancio Ortega’s vision, boosting revenue and international reach to turn the company into one of the world’s largest sellers of apparel.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>“Pablo Isla has an impressive track record with Inditex and has the trust of investors,” Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said in a note. Bulcke’s retirement was no surprise, he added, given that he’s 70.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Nestlé shares were little changed early Thursday in Zurich. They’ve risen 11% so far this year.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Bulcke’s pending departure, while carefully orchestrated, nonetheless marks the end of an era for the world’s biggest food company. He’s a Nestlé veteran of nearly five decades, having served in management roles in several countries and as CEO for almost nine years before becoming chairman in 2017. During his time as CEO, the company made a big push into new areas such as infant nutrition.</p></div>\n<h3>CEO change</h3>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Bulcke played a key role in elevating Freixe to the top role, bringing back another Nestlé insider after the reign of Schneider, who had joined the company from the health-care industry. Freixe’s strategy emphasises making fewer but larger bets on key brands, supported by increased advertising investment and a cost-saving programme.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>In recent years, Nestlé has had some mishaps, including a US$2.1 billion (RM8.9 billion) write-down on an investment in a peanut allergy medication. Then IT problems caused shortages at its vitamins and minerals unit.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Like other makers of branded consumer goods, the company has also struggled to keep consumers coming back to its products during periods of high inflation when private-label food and household items have gained popularity.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p><i>Uploaded by Magessan Varatharaja</i></p></div>\n</div></div>",
