The agency also confirmed the base tariff per kilowatt-hour (kWh) will be raised to 45.4 sen under the fourth regulatory period (RP4) from 39.95 sen under RP3.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The new system will take effect from July this year until December 2027.</p></div><div class=\"inPageAd\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-inpage\"></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Under the new system, the tariff will be adjusted up or down, depending on the difference between actual fuel prices and benchmarked fuel prices. However, the automatic increase is capped at three sen per kWh — and anything exceeding this threshold will require Cabinet approval.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>“This mechanism allows generation cost adjustment to be implemented automatically based on current market fuel prices and foreign exchange rate,” the EC said. The information will be reported on the commission’s website each month.</p></div>\n<div class=\"mt-3 imgw-400 embed-right\"><a class=\"mobx embedimg-icon\" data-rel=\"ceolightbox\" href=\"https://myassets.theedgemalaysia.com/pics/2025/electricity-tariff_20250620190838.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://myassets.theedgemalaysia.com/pics/2025/electricity-tariff_20250620190838.jpg\"/></a></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The base tariff, an average across all users, is reviewed every regulatory period lasting three years which takes into account potential spending required to expand or maintain the grid.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Under the current imbalance cost pass-through (ICPT) mechanism, the final tariff to be paid by consumers is adjusted every six months in the form of rebates or surcharges on top of the base tariff.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>If fuel costs exceed the projection, a surcharge will be levied, resulting in higher tariffs for the consumers, while a rebate will lower the final tariffs if fuel costs drop below forecasts.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The new base tariff of 45.4 sen per kWh comprises 12.98 sen for Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s (KL:<a class=\"ce-stock\" href=\"/askedge/klse/5347\" target=\"_blank\">TENAGA</a>) capital expenditure and 32.42 sen for generation costs, before any automatic adjustments.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The current base tariff of 39.95 sen per kWh, meanwhile, is based on 13.75 sen for Tenaga’s capital expenditure and 26.20 sen for generation costs. There is a 16 sen ICPT surcharge currently tacked on to the current tariff.</p></div>\n<h3>New ‘tiered’ structure; potential cost savings</h3>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Apart from changes to the tariff’s adjustment mechanism, the commission is also doing away with the tiered tariff system and is now categorising end-users based on consumption. The tariff will also be broken down into charge categories — energy, capacity, network and retail charges.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>User categories will comprise low, medium and high voltage — heavier users will face higher energy, capacity, network, and retail charges. Domestic users fall into the low-voltage category.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Further, electricity tariffs under RP4 will be further adjusted for domestic users if their consumption is at least 1,000 kWh and below, and low-voltage non-domestic users who use 200 kWh and below qualify for the Energy Efficiency Incentive (EEI).</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>There would be specific tariffs for agriculture, water services, sewage and rail operators, and a 10% rebate will be given to registered higher education institutions, schools, welfare homes and houses of worship.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The government will also continue the RM40 electricity bill rebate programme, offering monthly assistance of RM40 to households in the hardcore poor category and registered in the eKasih system.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>“Following the implementation of this new tariff schedule, the majority of users are expected not to be affected,” the EC said. “In fact, users who practise efficient energy usage will enjoy higher savings through the EEI.”</p></div>\n</div><div class=\"news-detail_editedByWrapper__jHZRc\"><span>Edited By</span><span>Jason Ng</span></div></div>",

            "description": "<div class=\"news-detail_newsTextDataWrap__PkAu5\"><div><div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>(June 20): The euro is taking on a bigger role in the global currency options market as traders skirt around the dollar given the risks from unpredictable US policy and a global trade war.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>There’s been a shift in trading volumes. Around 15% to 30% of contracts tied to the dollar versus major currencies were switched to the euro, looking at data from the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation for the first five months of this year versus the final five months of 2024. There are also signs the euro is being used as a haven — traditionally the dollar’s role — and for bets on big moves.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>While deals involving the dollar still dominate in the US$7.5 trillion (RM31.9 trillion)-a-day currency market, this could be early evidence that the greenback is facing greater competition as the world’s reserve currency. Traders are sidestepping the dollar after its biggest slump in years, with Europe’s common currency looking like a key beneficiary as the region’s markets benefit from billions in government stimulus spending.</p></div><div class=\"inPageAd\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-inpage\"></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>“If we’re moving to an environment in which the European flow story is more important, then we could be moving to an environment in which it’s euro pairs which are driving everything,” said Oliver Brennan, options strategist at BNP Paribas SA.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>So far this year, Europe’s common currency has rallied 11% against the dollar, hitting its highest since 2021 at above US$1.16. Meanwhile the dollar has slid against every major currency, with a gauge down over 7% to its lowest since 2022. That’s undermining trust in US assets.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>And the slump may not be over yet. Hedge fund heavyweight Paul Tudor Jones just predicted another 10% drop for the dollar over the next year. Risk reversals, a gauge of options sentiment, are becoming increasingly negative on the dollar against the yen, whereas they are turning less bearish on euro-yen — a “really important signal” on the euro for Brennan.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>As markets question the dollar’s stability, implied volatility in the euro against the yen is looking the calmest in nearly four years relative to swings between the greenback and Japanese currency.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>“The market is thinking that dollar-yen will be more volatile than euro-yen in a negative market shock, which is the opposite to how the market has traded these events in the past,” said Brennan. “If that’s the thinking, then it means the market sees the euro as more of a safe haven than the dollar.”</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The cost of options is also a driver, said Ben Ford, currency strategist at Macro Hive. While implied volatility generally has eased after spiking in April’s market chaos, it stands at nearly 11% over three months for dollar-yen, compared with under 9% for euro-yen.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>“The market is finding cheaper ways to express its view, especially given the view is probably for euro outperformance,” Ford said.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Traders also seem to be favoring the euro over the dollar when it comes to hedging or betting on big directional moves on the yen. That’s evident in so-called 10-delta fly spreads, a gauge of demand for outsized swings, where the gap between euro-yen and dollar-yen has been steadily widening since April.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Of course, the dollar has been written off many times before.

That implies a further 3% advance from Wednesday’s close, handing investors annual returns of about 10%.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Europe’s loosening monetary policy and increased government spending are forecast to give the region’s stocks the impetus they need to overcome risks from tariffs and rising international tensions. </p></div><div class=\"inPageAd\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-inpage\"></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>“Equity markets have been remarkably resilient, despite many risks,” said Citigroup Inc strategist Beata Manthey. She noted that global equity market valuations reflected relatively average levels of geo-economic risk in the lead up to the Israel-Iran conflict. “This could be worrisome from a short-term perspective, but over the longer term we see many structural tailwinds to support European equities.”</p></div>\n<div class=\"mt-3 imgw-400 embed-right\"><a class=\"mobx embedimg-icon\" data-rel=\"ceolightbox\" href=\"https://myassets.theedgemalaysia.com/pics/2025/434852310_20250620164850.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://myassets.theedgemalaysia.com/pics/2025/434852310_20250620164850.jpg\"/></a></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>European stocks have posted moderate moves since mid-May, following a V-shaped recovery that erased all the losses triggered by the US tariff announcements of early April. Recent weeks have proved more volatile, as Middle East tensions intensified and pushed oil prices higher. The Stoxx Europe 600 is down 1.5% this month, with energy shares and utilities the only sectors in the green.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>“Many investors we are speaking with are awaiting the end of the truce on US tariffs on July 9 to gain better visibility,” said Societe Generale SA strategist Roland Kaloyan. “Looking ahead, we anticipate that the European equity market will remain within a trading range.”</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Most strategists have had to chase the rally in Europe as the outlook brightened, updating the cautious price targets they drew up in January. Challenges to so-called US exceptionalism in stocks, Europe’s improving economic prospects, as well as a wide interest-rate differential have fuelled bets on the region.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The positive sentiment is also evident among investors. The Bank of America Corp fund manager survey conducted this month before Middle East tensions escalated showed that a net 34% of European investors expect stocks in the region to rise in the coming months. While that’s broadly unchanged from May, the net proportion expecting gains in the coming 12 months has rebounded to the February high of 75%.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>On a relative basis, asset allocators are increasingly bullish on Europe. A net 34% of portfolio managers in the BofA survey said they are overweight European equities against their funds’ benchmark levels — close to a four-year high. A net 36% said they are underweight US equities, nearly the most in two years.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>While investors haven’t lost sight of the risks posed by trade tariffs, they are growing more optimistic about the economy, which will feed into corporate profits, the survey showed.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>“Our view is that the diversification theme has further to go,” said Goldman Sachs Group Inc partner and chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer, adding the weakening dollar favors European assets. “In total returns, European stocks offer quite a compelling story for investors, especially given their starting point of having very concentrated portfolios, particularly in US equities.”</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>European stocks have outperformed US peers this year, but the gap is narrowing. Renewed appetite for American tech megacaps, potential tax cuts and optimism about trade negotiations helped the S&amp;P 500 erase its losses for 2025 last month.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Still, for Deutsche Bank AG strategists led by Maximilian Uleer, who’ve been consistently bullish on the outlook for the Stoxx 600, tariffs will be a bigger burden for US companies than their European peers. Earnings momentum and valuations are more favorable in Europe, while political uncertainty remains more of a problem, they said. The outlook for fiscal policy and interest rates also favours Europe, while a potential ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia would be an additional boost.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>“Once we have more clarity on US tariffs, the One Big Beautiful Bill, the German budget and fiscal package, as well as Nato spending, markets could start moving higher again in late summer,” the Deutsche Bank team said. “In the medium-term, European equities could start outperforming US equities again.”</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p><i>Uploaded by Magessan Varatharaja</i></p></div>\n</div></div>",

The park may comprise production lines for AI-powered industrial robots, they said, asking not to be named as the plan remains private.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>SoftBank officials are keen to have the Taiwanese maker of Nvidia Corp’s advanced AI chips play a prominent role in the project, although it’s not clear what part Son sees for TSMC, which already plans to invest US$165 billion (RM702.16 billion) in the US and has started mass production at its first Arizona factory. Nor is it clear that TSMC would be interested. A person familiar with the chipmaker’s thinking said that SoftBank’s project has no bearing on TSMC’s plans in Phoenix.</p></div><div class=\"inPageAd\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-inpage\"></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Shares of SoftBank jumped as much as 2.3% in Tokyo Friday. TSMC’s stock price rose 1.9% in Taipei.  </p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Codenamed “Project Crystal Land”, the Arizona complex represents the 67-year-old SoftBank chief’s most ambitious attempt in a career that’s spanned numerous bet-the-house bids, thousands-fold returns and billions of dollars in losses. Son, who’s often expressed disappointment in his own legacy, has repeatedly said he means to do everything he can to hurry AI development. </p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>SoftBank officials have spoken with federal and state government officials to discuss possible tax breaks for companies building factories or otherwise investing in the industrial park, including talks with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, the people said.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The Japanese billionaire is also personally sounding out interest among an array of tech companies, they said. The project has been floated to executives at South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co, they said. </p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Representatives of SoftBank, TSMC and Samsung declined to comment. A Commerce Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Son has pulled together a list of SoftBank Vision Fund portfolio companies that might take part in the Arizona manufacturing hub, the people said. SoftBank-backed startups working on robotics and automation technologies — such as Agile Robots SE — may set up production facilities at the industrial complex, they said.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>The plans are preliminary and feasibility hinges on support from the Trump administration and state officials. While the cost of the project as envisioned by Son may require as much as US$1 trillion to execute — a sum previously reported by the Nikkei — the actual scale depends on interest from big technology companies. If successful, Son has floated building multiple cutting-edge industrial parks across the US.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>SoftBank is exploring the Arizona project as it also moves forward on plans to invest as much as US$30 billion into OpenAI and plans a US$6.5 billion acquisition of Ampere Computing LLC. It’s also seeding money into the Stargate venture with OpenAI, Oracle Corp and Abu Dhabi’s MGX, seeking to ferry hundreds of billions of dollars into data centres and related infrastructure around the world.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Those outlays come as SoftBank’s cash stood at ¥3.4 trillion (US$23 billion or RM100 billion) at the end of March. The Tokyo-based company has since tapped its T-Mobile US Inc stake, selling roughly a quarter of what it held in March to raise US$4.8 billion this month. SoftBank also has net assets valued at ¥25.7 trillion, of which chip designer Arm Holdings plc makes the single largest portion, allowing it to borrow billions more as needed.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>SoftBank’s exploring project financing for Stargate data centres, a model that could be adapted to a big endeavour like Crystal Land. Common for large-scale infrastructure like oil or gas pipelines, the project finance template would allow the tech investor to raise funding on a project-by-project basis and require less money upfront.</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>Son’s restless search for growth has resulted in projects that proceed in fits and starts, making it difficult to gauge how committed he is to any one venture. The billionaire is often goaded by the desire to boost SoftBank’s stock price and repay retail investors who’ve held onto the company’s shares from before the dot-com boom and bust, people close to the SoftBank chief have said. Many investors have waited for decades for the stock to regain dot-com bubble levels — something it’s flirted with only a few times since 2020. </p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>If Son’s primary motivation is to clear the way for AI, it may be more cost-efficient to encourage partnerships that link manufacturing expertise with that of AI engineers and specialists in fields from medicine to robotics, and incubating smaller companies, according to Melissa Otto, head of research at Visible Alpha. </p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p>But pouring cash into data centres may help lower the cost of developing AI applications and spur broader adoption, she said. “He’s a long-term thinker, and he takes risks,” Otto said. “It’s just too early to tell.”</p></div>\n<div class=\"newsTextDataWrapInner\" style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><p><em>Uploaded by Chng Shear Lane</em></p></div>\n</div></div>",
