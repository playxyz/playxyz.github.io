Security spending is expected to remain robust throughout the 2023–2028 forecast period, reaching nearly $97 billion by 2028.</p><p>The Czech Republic and Hungary are expected to record the fastest growth in security spending in Europe in 2025, with year-on-year increases of 15.4% and 14.1%, respectively, as organizations in these countries continue to strengthen their security capabilities and align with advanced standards amid rapid digital transformation. The third-fastest-growing country in Europe in 2025 in terms of security spending will be Ireland, with a growth of 13.3% over 2024, reinforcing its position as a cutting-edge technology hub — including in the area of security. </p><p>Security software is projected to be the largest and fastest-growing technology group in Europe, accounting for over half of total security spending and with an expected year-on-year growth rate of 14.8%.

            "description": "<div class=\"big-box\">\n<p><b>SINGAPORE, 8 April 2025 –</b> <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/ap\">IDC</a> predicts that, by 2027, insurers that integrate AI with FinOps will be able to consistently realize 45% more value from their IT investments, driven by informed automation at scale. This is just one of the predictions unveiled in the <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=AP51518924&amp;pageType=PRINTFRIENDLY\"> IDC FutureScape: Worldwide Insurance  2025 Predictions — Asia/Pacific (Excluding Japan) Implications</a> report. The prediction reflects a growing shift toward AI-driven financial governance, where dynamic expense management, predictive analytics, and real-time insights empower insurers to optimize costs, improve operations, and gain a competitive edge.</p><p>Digital Infrastructure is a key foundational enabler to succeed in this age of \"AI Everywhere\". IDC's research shows that “<i>Modernizing core IT infrastructure</i>” is the #1 IT modernization initiative Asia/Pacific enterprises are planning to undertake in the next 18 months. The future enterprise digital infrastructure fabric will be decidedly hybrid, spanning public clouds, dedicated private cloud environments, private non-cloud IT and edge environments. With these environments expected to feature a cocktail of AI models and agents that will drive business value, enterprise decision-making relating to digital infra choices for AI will be the key to business outperformance and competitive differentiation in this exciting new world.</p><p>AI-driven FinOps is poised to transform financial strategy for insurers across Asia, enabling smarter IT spending, real-time insights, and scalable automation. As regulatory pressures and competition intensify, insurers are prioritizing AI-powered tools for cloud cost management, predictive expense control, and financial governance. This shift promises not only improved profitability and operational agility, but also opens the door to region-specific innovation. Embracing AI-enabled financial intelligence will be essential for insurers to remain competitive, resilient, and growth-focused in a rapidly evolving landscape.</p><p>\"Global insurers must balance cost optimization with digital transformation. AI-driven FinOps offers a path to smarter IT spending, but success depends on seamless integration, risk mitigation, and maximizing ROI in an increasingly complex landscape,\" says <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=PRF005671\">Surya Narayan Saha</a>, research manager, Insurance Research, IDC Asia/Pacific.</p><p>IDC’s report presents the top 10 predictions for the ApeJ insurance industry through 2029.

Celebrating its 60th anniversary, this year’s conference — themed “Transforming Business for an AI World” — marks six decades of bringing together industry leaders to explore what’s next in technology. The event highlights the pivotal role AI plays in today's business landscape and provides actionable strategies for success. </p><p>For most organizations still navigating the “AI Pivot,” it is a critical turning point. What enterprises do at this stage will determine how fast they can get to a repeatable set of processes that will set them up for business transformation. To address this juncture, IDC’s Global AI Research Council is releasing three distinct research studies designed to offer strategic guidance for organizations navigating AI:</p><p><b>IDC MaturityScape: AI-Fueled Organization 1.0</b> focuses on AI organizational maturity, revealing a critical shift in how companies approach technological innovation. Currently, 51% of businesses are taking an opportunistic approach to AI, but there's a significant trend toward more structured and strategic adoption. The research highlights how organizations are increasingly viewing AI as a fundamental transformation of business, operating, and organizational models. Governance, knowledge, and skills are emerging as key elements in implementing AI-driven transformation. Companies are moving beyond ad-hoc experimentation, with about 35% now developing more repeatable and managed AI strategies.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US53272524\"><b>Agentic AI Impact on Enterprises</b></a> explores the disruptive potential of agentic AI, analyzing its impact on the technology stack (infrastructure, data management, software development, automation platforms and SaaS applications/platforms) and professional roles. This research provides strategic guidance for responsible AI adoption, positioning agentic systems as a core driver of business innovation and competitive advantage.</p><p><b>GenAI Industry-specific Use Case Adoption</b> emphasizes which industry-specific use cases will be top investment areas for the next 12 months. As organizations prepare to exit the “AI Pivot” — shifting some of their focus from productivity gains to revenue generation — applying an industry-specific focus lens to use cases becomes integral to achieving faster results. Preliminary findings from the study underscore the importance of strategic vendor partnerships and robust internal data preparation for successful AI initiatives.</p><p>\"When it comes to AI, decision-makers often struggle to find a practical entry point that aligns with their organization's needs,\" said Meredith Whalen, chief research &amp; data officer at IDC. “This new research helps leaders understand AI from a strategic business perspective – highlighting its potential to transform their business and enhance competitiveness, rather than treating it solely as a technological innovation.”</p><p>Ritu Jyoti, group vice president/general manager of IDC's Worldwide AI and Data Research Practice, added, \"Our research will provide clarity around agentic AI, addressing market misconceptions and demonstrating how disciplined and responsible strategies can unlock genuine business value.\"</p><p>IDC Directions brings together industry leaders to explore these cutting-edge insights, offering a comprehensive look at how artificial intelligence is reshaping the digital landscape. Attendees gain strategic insights into AI adoption and transformation, positioned at the intersection of technological innovation and business strategy.</p><p>###</p><p><b>About IDC</b></p><p>International Data Corporation (IDC) is the premier global provider of market intelligence, advisory services, and events for the information technology, telecommunications, and consumer technology markets.
